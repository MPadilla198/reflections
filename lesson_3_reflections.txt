When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others, when saving progress on the cloud to have access to the code on any other computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By pulling manually, the developer has the option of choosing when to showcase a new feature to others.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a variation of someone else's project on GitHub. A clone is a project on GitHub being brought to local as a repository. A branch is a variation in the code.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To be able to modify the most recent version of the application.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Saving file versions to a flash drive and everyone who wanted to participate would get a copy of the flash drive and opy it to their computer. It would be easier by not being as technical as using Git or GitHub, but it would be harder in that it'll require a lot more time and energy to be spent in spreading file changes to everybody when a change is made.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When collaborating with others. This allows others to view the changes that you have made and respond to them before you just add the changes without their knowing.
